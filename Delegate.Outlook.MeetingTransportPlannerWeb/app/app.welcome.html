            The length of the transport placeholder is automatically calculated by Google's driving service.
            Their service take into account the traffic at the time of the meeting ensuring you have sufficient time
            to get to or from your meeting on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            All you have to do is to supply the driving origin and destination for the meeting.
            You are also always able to adjust the suggested placeholder time, if you feel you need more or less time, before adding the transport placeholder appointment to your calendar.


        </p>
        <p>
            In the future the add-in will be able to remember you most used locations, to make it even easier to book transport placeholders.
